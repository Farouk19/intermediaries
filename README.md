# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the Front-end

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Start the Back-end

### `npm start` or `npm run start:dev`

## Missing parts

### Front-end

-   Save an edited intermediary, it's implemented in the Front-end and Back-end but it doesn't work properly.

-   The Dropdown type is not handled.

-   Product edit/add form.

-   Save, edit and delete a product.

-   Unit tests.

### Back-end

-   The data is handled statically, neither database, nor ORM were used.

## Bugs

-   Can't change the color or the hoverColor properties of the CustomButton Component.

-   The 'To', 'From' and 'step' fields are not shown in edit mode

-   The 'To' input field of the Intermediary is not working.

-   A refresh is required after some operations like opening the Edit intermediary form, add an intermediary, delete an intermediary

## Enhancements

-   Write some tests

-   Use Docker and Docker Compose
